The obtained conformers were optimized by the xtb program at GFN2 level [18] and the conformers within an energy window of 5\\u00a0kcal/mol were kept. These conformers were reoptimized at B3LYP-D3BJ/6-31G(d) with IEFPCM solvent model in chloroform and frequency analysis of all optimized conformers were also performed at the same level of theory to ensure no imaginary frequencies. NMR shielding tensors were calculated with the GIAO method [19] at mPW1PW91/6\\u201331\\u00a0+\\u00a0G(d,p) level with IEFPCM solvent model in chloroform. The shielding constants were converted into chemical shifts by referencing to TMS at 0\\u00a0ppm (\\u03b4cal\\u00a0=\\u00a0\\u03c3TMS \\u2013 \\u03c3cal), where the \\u03c3TMS (the shielding constant of TMS) was calculated at the same level. For each candidate, the parameters a and b of the linear regression \\u03b4cal\\u00a0=\\u00a0a\\u03b4exp\\u00a0+\\u00a0b; the correlation coefficient, R2; the mean absolute error (MAE) defined as \\u03a3n |\\u03b4cal \\u2013 \\u03b4exp|/n; the corrected mean absolute error, CMAE, defined as \\u03a3n |\\u03b4corr\\u2013\\u03b4exp|/n, where \\u03b4corr = (\\u03b4cal \\u2013 b)/a, were calculated. DP4\\u00a0+\\u00a0probability analysis was performed using the unscaled NMR chemical shifts [20]. ECD spectra were calculated by the TDDFT methodology at the B3LYP/TZVP utilizing IEFPCM in methanol. ECD spectra were simulated using SpecDis 1.71 [21] with \\u03c3\\u00a0=\\u00a00.30 ev.\",\n          \"Analysis of compound 12 by FABMS showed an [M+H]+ peak of m/z 655, revealing the compound to be a dimer of 1. Taken together with its 13C NMR and elemental analysis data, the molecular formula of 12 was assigned as C32H30O15. The 1H\\u00a0and 13C NMR spectra of 12 indicated the presence of a pyrogallol ring (B-ring) and two sets of flavan A- and C-rings, which were similar to those of 11. The 13C NMR spectrum revealed the presence of a nonconjugated carbonyl (\\u03b4\\n                        C 213.1, C-3\\u2034), a carboxyl (\\u03b4\\n                        C 170.4, C-6\\u2034), two quaternary carbons (\\u03b4\\n                        C 92.3, C-1\\u2034; \\u03b4\\n                        C 85.8, C-4\\u2034), a methine (\\u03b4\\n                        C 59.3, C-5\\u2034), and a methylene (\\u03b4\\n                        C 44.3, C-2\\u2034) carbon. Furthermore, HMBC correlations (Fig.\\u00a04) revealed that the carboxyl group formed an ethyl ester (\\u03b4\\n                        H 0.95, 3H, t, CH3; \\u03b4\\n                        H 3.72 and 3.82, each 1H, m, CH2). The remaining HMBC correlations of the methine (H-5\\u2034), methylene (H-2\\u2034), and C-ring H-2 and H-2\\u2033 protons indicated the presence of a cyclopentanone ring (C-1\\u2034\\u2013C-5\\u2034). The degree of unsaturation was calculated to be 18 based on the molecular formula, while the unusual low-field shift of the C-1\\u2034 signal (\\u03b4\\n                        C 92.3), which is very similar to that of C-1\\u2034 in 11 (\\u03b4\\n                        C 94.4), suggested that there was an ether ring between the C-1\\u2034 and pyrogallol C-3\\u2032. Thus, the planar structure of 12 was assigned as shown in Fig.\\u00a03. The structural relationship between this product and 11 led us to propose a new mechanism for their generation from dehydrotheasinensin C (5) (Scheme 1\\n                        ). Compound 12 was produced by the addition of ethanol, which was used to terminate the enzymatic reaction, to the oxidized pyrogallol ring. In contrast, the addition of water to the same oxidized pyrogallol ring followed by decarboxylation afforded an enediol intermediate, and the subsequent oxidation of the enediol produced 11.\\n                           19\\n                         This newly proposed mechanism also suggested that the stereostructures of the C-1\\u2034 and C-5\\u2034 positions in 12 were the same as those of 11. The 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts of (4\\u2034S)-12 and (4\\u2034R)-12 were calculated to determine the configuration at the C-4\\u2034 position.\\n                           20\\n                         Low-energy conformers within 6\\u00a0kcal/mol were initially obtained following a conformational search using the Monte Carlo method at the MMFF94 force field, and these conformers were subsequently optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in acetone (PCM). The 1H\\u00a0and 13C NMR chemical shifts of the low-energy conformers with high Boltzmann populations (>1%) were calculated using the gauge-including atomic orbital (GIAO) at the mPW1PW91/6-311+G(2d,p) level in acetone (PCM). The experimental 1H\\u00a0and 13C NMR chemical shifts of 12 agreed to a much greater extent with the calculated values for (4\\u2034S)-12 (correlation coefficient R\\n                        2=0.9908 for 1H NMR; R\\n                        2=0.9992 for 13C NMR) than (4\\u2034R)-12 (R\\n                        2=0.9733 for 1H NMR; R\\n                        2=0.9979 for 13C NMR) (see Supplementary data for details). Based on these results, the structure of 12 was assigned as shown in Fig.\\u00a03.\",\n          \"The 1H MAE analysis presented in Table 2 indicated that the calculated chemical shifts of the diatereoisomeric mixture of 3 and 4 correlate better with the substructures from group A (Fig. 3), meaning that the proton from C\\u00a0\\u2212\\u00a03\\u2032 is directed towards the back of the bicyclic ring system. This is also observed for the absolute error, given that the error for the incorrectly matched pair B is approximately 1.6 times bigger for both cases. This trend is reversed for the correlations made from 13C chemical shifts, as the MAE and absolute error for the substructures of group B are that 13C calculated chemical shifts from this level of theory is not useful for a clear distinction between stereoisomers and being so, one can safely assume that the 1H analysis is more relevant for this study [49,50]. Thus, the calculated chemical shifts indicate that the C\\u00a0\\u2212\\u00a03\\u2032 stereocenter has S absolute configuration.

(2014) to provide nonspecialists with a useful tool for validating putative structural assignments. However, experimentally acquired 1H and/or 13C NMR spectral data and its proper interpretation for the compound of interest is required as a starting point. Their approach described the following steps: (i) using molecular mechanics (MM) calculations (with, e.g., the modelling package MacroModel) to generate a library of conformers (usually within 50 Kcal of the ground state); (ii) using DFT calculations (with, e.g., Gaussian 09) to determine the optimal low energy geometry (rather than a saddle point), free energies, and chemical shifts for each conformer; (iii) determining Boltzmann-weighted 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts; and (iv) comparing the computed chemical shifts for two (or more) candidate structures with the experimentally determined data to determine the best fit. The authors suggest that for a typical structure assignment of a small organic molecule (e.g., fewer than around 10 non-H atoms or up to about 180 a.m.u. and \\u223c 20 conformers), this protocol could be completed in approximately 2 h of active effort over a 2-day period. For more complex molecules, including natural products (e.g., fewer than \\u223c 30 non-H atoms or up to \\u223c 500 a.m.u. and \\u223c 50 conformers), the protocol could require around 3\\u20136 h of active effort over a 2-week period. Their protocol is written in a step-wise tutorial fashion that enables the computation of chemical shifts tractable for chemists who only possess a rudimentary computational knowledge.\",\n          \"1H NMR chemical shifts were calculated by Boltzmann-weighted averaging of the shifts of each conformer as described in Ref. 24. The prediction of absolute chemical shifts at 4/4\\u2032 and 5/5\\u2032 yielded differences of \\u22640.84 ppm from experimental values, which may indicate that either the chosen level of theory is insufficient to capture the complex electronic effects of the opposing \\u03c0-systems on the shielding of these nuclei, or that one or more important conformers that significantly contribute to the equilibrium population were missed during conformational sampling.\",\n          \"Conformational searches were performed on four possible diastereomers of 3 by Spartan\\u201914 software (Wavefunction, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) using the MMFF force field. The resulting conformers which occurred within a 5\\u2009kcal/mol energy window from the global minima were subjected to geometry optimization and frequency calculations with Gaussian 09 software (Gaussian 09, Revision C.01, Gaussian, Inc., Wallingford, CT, USA) at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory. Gauge-including atomic orbital (GIAO) NMR calculations were performed on the optimized conformers within 2\\u2009kcal/mol of the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) lowest-energy conformers at the mPW1PW91/6-311\\u2009G(d) level in the gas phase.

These conformers were reoptimized at B3LYP-D3BJ/6-31G(d) with IEFPCM solvent model in chloroform and frequency analysis of all optimized conformers were also performed at the same level of theory to ensure no imaginary frequencies.

The shielding constants were converted into chemical shifts by referencing to TMS at 0\\u00a0ppm (\\u03b4cal\\u00a0=\\u00a0\\u03c3TMS \\u2013 \\u03c3cal), where the \\u03c3TMS (the shielding constant of TMS) was calculated at the same level. For each candidate, the parameters a and b of the linear regression \\u03b4cal\\u00a0=\\u00a0a\\u03b4exp\\u00a0+\\u00a0b; the correlation coefficient, R2; the mean absolute error (MAE) defined as \\u03a3n |\\u03b4cal \\u2013 \\u03b4exp|/n; the corrected mean absolute error, CMAE, defined as \\u03a3n |\\u03b4corr\\u2013\\u03b4exp|/n, where \\u03b4corr = (\\u03b4cal \\u2013 b)/a, were calculated. DP4\\u00a0+\\u00a0probability analysis was performed using the unscaled NMR chemical shifts [20]. ECD spectra were calculated by the TDDFT methodology at the B3LYP/TZVP utilizing IEFPCM in methanol. ECD spectra were simulated using SpecDis 1.71 [21] with \\u03c3\\u00a0=\\u00a00.30 ev.\",\n          \"Analysis of compound 12 by FABMS showed an [M+H]+ peak of m/z 655, revealing the compound to be a dimer of 1. Taken together with its 13C NMR and elemental analysis data, the molecular formula of 12 was assigned as C32H30O15. The 1H\\u00a0and 13C NMR spectra of 12 indicated the presence of a pyrogallol ring (B-ring) and two sets of flavan A- and C-rings, which were similar to those of 11. The 13C NMR spectrum revealed the presence of a nonconjugated carbonyl (\\u03b4\\n                        C 213.1, C-3\\u2034), a carboxyl (\\u03b4\\n                        C 170.4, C-6\\u2034), two quaternary carbons (\\u03b4\\n                        C 92.3, C-1\\u2034; \\u03b4\\n                        C 85.8, C-4\\u2034), a methine (\\u03b4\\n                        C 59.3, C-5\\u2034), and a methylene (\\u03b4\\n                        C 44.3, C-2\\u2034) carbon. Furthermore, HMBC correlations (Fig.\\u00a04) revealed that the carboxyl group formed an ethyl ester (\\u03b4\\n                        H 0.95, 3H, t, CH3; \\u03b4\\n                        H 3.72 and 3.82, each 1H, m, CH2). The remaining HMBC correlations of the methine (H-5\\u2034), methylene (H-2\\u2034), and C-ring H-2 and H-2\\u2033 protons indicated the presence of a cyclopentanone ring (C-1\\u2034\\u2013C-5\\u2034). The degree of unsaturation was calculated to be 18 based on the molecular formula, while the unusual low-field shift of the C-1\\u2034 signal (\\u03b4\\n                        C 92.3), which is very similar to that of C-1\\u2034 in 11 (\\u03b4\\n                        C 94.4), suggested that there was an ether ring between the C-1\\u2034 and pyrogallol C-3\\u2032. Thus, the planar structure of 12 was assigned as shown in Fig.\\u00a03. The structural relationship between this product and 11 led us to propose a new mechanism for their generation from dehydrotheasinensin C (5) (Scheme 1\\n                        ). Compound 12 was produced by the addition of ethanol, which was used to terminate the enzymatic reaction, to the oxidized pyrogallol ring. In contrast, the addition of water to the same oxidized pyrogallol ring followed by decarboxylation afforded an enediol intermediate, and the subsequent oxidation of the enediol produced 11.\\n                           19\\n                         This newly proposed mechanism also suggested that the stereostructures of the C-1\\u2034 and C-5\\u2034 positions in 12 were the same as those of 11. The 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts of (4\\u2034S)-12 and (4\\u2034R)-12 were calculated to determine the configuration at the C-4\\u2034 position.\\n                           20\\n                         Low-energy conformers within 6\\u00a0kcal/mol were initially obtained following a conformational search using the Monte Carlo method at the MMFF94 force field, and these conformers were subsequently optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in acetone (PCM). The 1H\\u00a0and 13C NMR chemical shifts of the low-energy conformers with high Boltzmann populations (>1%) were calculated using the gauge-including atomic orbital (GIAO) at the mPW1PW91/6-311+G(2d,p) level in acetone (PCM). The experimental 1H\\u00a0and 13C NMR chemical shifts of 12 agreed to a much greater extent with the calculated values for (4\\u2034S)-12 (correlation coefficient R\\n                        2=0.9908 for 1H NMR; R\\n                        2=0.9992 for 13C NMR) than (4\\u2034R)-12 (R\\n                        2=0.9733 for 1H NMR; R\\n                        2=0.9979 for 13C NMR) (see Supplementary data for details). Based on these results, the structure of 12 was assigned as shown in Fig.\\u00a03.\",\n          \"The 1H MAE analysis presented in Table 2 indicated that the calculated chemical shifts of the diatereoisomeric mixture of 3 and 4 correlate better with the substructures from group A (Fig. 3), meaning that the proton from C\\u00a0\\u2212\\u00a03\\u2032 is directed towards the back of the bicyclic ring system. This is also observed for the absolute error, given that the error for the incorrectly matched pair B is approximately 1.6 times bigger for both cases. This trend is reversed for the correlations made from 13C chemical shifts, as the MAE and absolute error for the substructures of group B are that 13C calculated chemical shifts from this level of theory is not useful for a clear distinction between stereoisomers and being so, one can safely assume that the 1H analysis is more relevant for this study [49,50]. Thus, the calculated chemical shifts indicate that the C\\u00a0\\u2212\\u00a03\\u2032 stereocenter has S absolute configuration.
