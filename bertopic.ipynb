They not only are the most pro- ductive source for the development of new drugs1 but also greatly inspire chemists to develop new synthetic strategies and methodologies by challenging the state-of-the-art chemi- cal synthesis.2 Their molecular structures including the rela- tive and absolute configurations are of paramount importance to these roles, in particular, to total synthesis and drug dis- covery. However, many natural products were reported with wrong structural assignments if suitable single crystals were unavail- able for X-ray diffraction analysis.3 There are few general methods available for structural corrections and confirmation besides NMR analysis4 including computational NMR methods and total synthesis. Although unambiguous, total synthesis usually requires tremendous synthetic efforts with considerable cost and time.5 For example, recent synthetic studies6 including one from our group consistently revealed that the structures for cephalosporolides H and I7 and penisporolide B8 were incorrect and that the relative con- figuration of the tricyclic [5,5]-spiroacetal-cis-fused-\\u03b3-lactone (SAFL) should be revised (Fig. 1). In light of the potential bio- logical activity of this family of compounds and new members of SAFL-containing natural products probably being isolated in the future, we are interested in developing a reliable NMR analysis method (similar to the Kishi NMR database4e,f or Rychnovsky acetonide 13C-NMR analysis4g) to determine the relative configuration of the SAFL core without synthetic studies. Prior observation of the spiro-differentiating spin\\u2013 spin coupling (SSC) pattern first by Ramana9 and then by Britton10 and Brimble6f further inspired us to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the NMR data of the SAFLs reported in the literature and our laboratory with the expectation of stereochemical discrimination of all four possible diastereo- mers using only the NMR analysis method. Note: since the \\u03b3-lactone of the SAFLs is always cis-fused to the spiroacetal with the same configuration (3R,4R or 3S,4S), there are only four diastereomers derived from the four chiral centers (C3, C4, C6 and C9), namely, SAFL-A with the (3S*,4S*,6S*,9R*) relative configuration, (3S*,4S*,6R*,9R*) SAFL-B, (3R*,4R*,6S*,9R*) SAFL-C, and (3R*,4R*,6R*,9R*) SAFL-D (Fig. 1).\",\n          \"For a second demonstration of ISiCLE, the NMR chemical shifts, along with frequency calculations (and subsequent Boltzmann weighting), two sets of axial and equatorial conformers (40 conformers each) of methyl- cyclohexane were processed. We performed in vacuo molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, using the sander MD software program from AmberTools (version 14) [106], to generate 80 conformers of the methylcyclohex- ane compound. These conformers were generated in four stages. First, the initial geometries of axial and equato- rial conformers were taken from the study of Willoughby et al. [92]. Second, a short energy minimization run was performed to relax the initial structure and to remove any non-physical atom contacts. Third, a short 50 ps MD run was performed (in 0.5 fs time steps) to heat the struc- ture from 0 to 300 K, without non-bonded cutoffs. In the fourth step, we performed 8 simulated annealing cycles, where each cycle was run for 1600 ps in 1 fs MD steps with the following temperature profile: heating from 300 to 600 K (0\\u2013300 ps), equilibration at 600 K (300\\u2013800 ps), cooling from 600 to 300 K (800\\u20131100 ps), and equilibra- tion at 300 K (1100\\u20131600 ps). Ten conformers from the equilibration stage at 300 K, of each simulated annealing cycle, were randomly selected to obtain the 80 conform- ers. After the conformers were obtained, M06-2X was used with the basis set of 6-31+G(d,p) for the geometry optimization and frequency calculations and B3LYP with 6-311+G(2d,p) method for the calculations of NMR chemical shifts. Relative free energies of the conforma- tions and Boltzmann weighted NMR chemical shifts were compared to those found in the literature [92, 107\\u2013109].\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\":

They not only are the most pro- ductive source for the development of new drugs1 but also greatly inspire chemists to develop new synthetic strategies and methodologies by challenging the state-of-the-art chemi- cal synthesis.2 Their molecular structures including the rela- tive and absolute configurations are of paramount importance to these roles, in particular, to total synthesis and drug dis- covery. However, many natural products were reported with wrong structural assignments if suitable single crystals were unavail- able for X-ray diffraction analysis.3 There are few general methods available for structural corrections and confirmation besides NMR analysis4 including computational NMR methods and total synthesis. Although unambiguous, total synthesis usually requires tremendous synthetic efforts with considerable cost and time.5 For example, recent synthetic studies6 including one from our group consistently revealed that the structures for cephalosporolides H and I7 and penisporolide B8 were incorrect and that the relative con- figuration of the tricyclic [5,5]-spiroacetal-cis-fused-\\u03b3-lactone (SAFL) should be revised (Fig. 1). In light of the potential bio- logical activity of this family of compounds and new members of SAFL-containing natural products probably being isolated in the future, we are interested in developing a reliable NMR analysis method (similar to the Kishi NMR database4e,f or Rychnovsky acetonide 13C-NMR analysis4g) to determine the relative configuration of the SAFL core without synthetic studies. Prior observation of the spiro-differentiating spin\\u2013 spin coupling (SSC) pattern first by Ramana9 and then by Britton10 and Brimble6f further inspired us to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the NMR data of the SAFLs reported in the literature and our laboratory with the expectation of stereochemical discrimination of all four possible diastereo- mers using only the NMR analysis method. Note: since the \\u03b3-lactone of the SAFLs is always cis-fused to the spiroacetal with the same configuration (3R,4R or 3S,4S), there are only four diastereomers derived from the four chiral centers (C3, C4, C6 and C9), namely, SAFL-A with the (3S*,4S*,6S*,9R*) relative configuration, (3S*,4S*,6R*,9R*) SAFL-B, (3R*,4R*,6S*,9R*) SAFL-C, and (3R*,4R*,6R*,9R*) SAFL-D (Fig. 1).\",\n          \"For a second demonstration of ISiCLE, the NMR chemical shifts, along with frequency calculations (and subsequent Boltzmann weighting), two sets of axial and equatorial conformers (40 conformers each) of methyl- cyclohexane were processed. We performed in vacuo molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, using the sander MD software program from AmberTools (version 14) [106], to generate 80 conformers of the methylcyclohex- ane compound. These conformers were generated in four stages. First, the initial geometries of axial and equato- rial conformers were taken from the study of Willoughby et al. [92]. Second, a short energy minimization run was performed to relax the initial structure and to remove any non-physical atom contacts. Third, a short 50 ps MD run was performed (in 0.5 fs time steps) to heat the struc- ture from 0 to 300 K, without non-bonded cutoffs. In the fourth step, we performed 8 simulated annealing cycles, where each cycle was run for 1600 ps in 1 fs MD steps with the following temperature profile: heating from 300 to 600 K (0\\u2013300 ps), equilibration at 600 K (300\\u2013800 ps), cooling from 600 to 300 K (800\\u20131100 ps), and equilibra- tion at 300 K (1100\\u20131600 ps). Ten conformers from the equilibration stage at 300 K, of each simulated annealing cycle, were randomly selected to obtain the 80 conform- ers. After the conformers were obtained, M06-2X was used with the basis set of 6-31+G(d,p) for the geometry optimization and frequency calculations and B3LYP with 6-311+G(2d,p) method for the calculations of NMR chemical shifts. Relative free energies of the conforma- tions and Boltzmann weighted NMR chemical shifts were compared to those found in the literature [92, 107\\u2013109].\",\n          \"For flexible organic molecules with multiple conformations, it is necessary to consider how this will affect the chemical shift. As con- formational interconversion is generally rapid on the NMR timescale, the observed chemical shift will be a weighted average over all of the individual conformations. NMR calculations for individual conforma- tions must be performed separately, and the chemical shifts averaged to produce an ensemble average value for each position. Assuming a thermal equilibrium between the conformers, the Boltzmann weight- ing factors for each conformer (wi) can be obtained from the relative Gibbs energies (Eq. (6.3)) The sum of the Boltzmann-weighted shielding tensors obtained sepa- rately for each conformation is then comparable to the experimental, time-averaged value. In practice, it is often expedient to assume that the entropy and volume associated with each conformation is effec- tively identical, because this enables relative energies to be used in Eq. (6.3) (rather than Gibbs energies) and avoids the need to perform several frequency calculations. For molecules with only a handful of conformations, it may be feasible to manually optimize and perform the NMR calculations. In more flexible cases, this may be a more daunting proposition and it will become desirable to automate the task of conformational searching (see Chapter 5): this is possible using numerous programs, although inevitably an inexpensive com- putational method (e.g., MM) must be used. The low-energy con- formations are selected and reoptimized at a higher level of theory or may be used directly to compute shielding tensors. Willoughby et al. 9 have produced a helpful workflow to assist in carrying out this sequence of steps for flexible organic molecules.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 3,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          3,\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1_nmr_chemical_shifts_chemical shifts\",\n          \"3_cal_tms_shielding_calculated\",\n          \"2_nmr_chemical_data_configuration\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Representation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Representative_Docs\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top_n_words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"nmr -
